Data analysis & Visualization using Power BI 

Used Microsoft Power BI and Microsoft Excel to clean, and analyze the dataset about job postings of the wuzzuf website.
I've spent so much time in the cleaning phase in this project trying to understand how should I impute or deal with the huge number of errors and inconsistinces,
mainly be the power query editor where used techniques such as splitting, grouping, pivoting, structuring, and validating the dataset to make it ready for
the analysis and visualization of key metrics and KPIs to then compile all of this in the form of a power BI dashboard with the key insights and findings.

You can find the main presentation (Dashboard) and the Power BI document in this repository as well as a file containing a video explaination of the porject in Arabic
and the dataset itself. some of the important steps can also be found in documentation file in a PDF format.
